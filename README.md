# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Description
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a Python-based application designed to visually demonstrate how different sorting algorithms work. Developed using Tkinter for the graphical user interface and matplotlib for the visualizations, this project serves as an educational tool to understand sorting algorithms' behavior and efficiency.

## Features
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Includes Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualizes the sorting process in real-time, allowing users to see how algorithms manipulate data.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Users can modify the size of the data array and the speed of the visualization.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed using Tkinter with a clean and simple interface for easy interaction.

## Installation
To run the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, ensure you have Python installed on your system along with Tkinter and matplotlib libraries.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo.
3. Install the required libraries (if not already installed):
4. Run the application:


## Usage
After launching the application:
- Choose the algorithm you want to visualize from the dropdown menu.
- Adjust the array size and sorting speed as desired.
- Click 'Shuffle' to shuffle the array, and 'Sort' to start the visualization.
- 'Cancel' can be used to stop the sorting process.
